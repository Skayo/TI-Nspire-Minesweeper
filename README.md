# TI-Nspire Minesweeper
A simple Minesweeper-Clone made for the TI-Nspire with Lua.

The images used are from the original Minesweeper Game. I don't own them.<br>
**Warning:** This game is only tested on TI-Nspire CX and TI-Nspire CX CAS (OS Version 4.5), so there might be bugs on other platforms.

## Controls
Move Cursor = Arrow Keys<br>
Open Cell = Enter<br>
Flag Cell = (-)    or    F<br>
Press menu to change difficulty or to enable/disable marks.<br>

## How to play
The goal of this game is to open all cells.
If you open a cell with a mine, you loose!
The numbers on the cells tell you how many mines there are in the 8 adjacent cells.
Flag a cell if you are sure that there is a mine under it.


## How to Build
The resources files needed to build the project can be imported in the script editor with their default names using the CX Student Software (every image in the resource folder needs to be imported).
